This is an old cracked launcher for Minecraft java edition. It is NOT created by me and the official site is **https://www.skaiacraft.net/**. The download on the site is broken and I haven't seen many websites have it. Also, it works on Windows 10 school laptops. This is the main reason why I uploaded this as github is also unblocked by schools. The launcher might still work, you need to install the Minecraft version you want at home then you can play during school. You can also just put the Minecraft version you want in the versions directory that the launcher should make.
If the launcher doesn't open run jarfix.exe
